#Introduction
CrafTuX is a test project using OpenGL and Qt4. You are in a 3D world with randomly generated cubes, and you can fall thanks to the physic engine.

#Download
##Linux 64 bits
If you are on Linux, and 64 bits, there is a build for you at the [download section](https://github.com/Glycaa/CrafTuX/downloads).
You must have Qt librairies installed, since they are not provided in the zip.

#Building
In order to compile CraftTuX, you must have Qt and OpenGL development librairies installed. An easy way to do this is to download the [QtSDK](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/).
Then download the source and open `CrafTuX.pro`, in QtCreator for example. You just have to click on compile :)
