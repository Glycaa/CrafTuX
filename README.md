#Introduction
CrafTuX is a test project using OpenGL and Qt4.

#Building
In order to compile CraftTuX, you must have a Qt installed. An easy way to do this is to download the [QtSDK](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/).
Then download the source and open CrafTuX.pro, in QtCreator for example. You just have to click on compile :)
